## Part 1: Interpretability (39 patterns)

### One-line Summary

Without opening up the model's interior, safety cannot be guaranteed -- interpretability is an essential tool for AI safety and a new microscope for scientific discovery.

### WHY

Large language models influence the daily lives of billions, yet nobody knows what happens inside. Hallucination detection is post-hoc (slow), alignment verification is limited to behavioral tests, and bias audits rely on statistical estimation. Recent work (Bricken et al. 2023) demonstrating that features extracted via SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) correspond to internal conceptual representations of the model established that structural interpretation is a feasible pattern.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

| Parameter | Value | n=6 Basis |
|---------|-----|---------|
| SAE over-complete ratio | 8x (d_model) | 2^3 = 8, nearest 2^k to 6 |
| Sparse active feature count | sqrt(d_latent) = 64 | 64 = digits of 6+4 sum = 10 -> natural sparsity |
| Latent dimension | d_model x 8 = 4096 | 4096 = 2^12, sigma(6)=12 |
| 3 main axes | SAE improvement 15 + circuit discovery 12 + tooling 12 | 15+12+12 = 39 = 6x6+3 |
| Verification sections | 11 (7.0~7.10) | sigma(6)-1 = 11 |
| Limit items | 7 | perfect number 6+1 = 7 |

## Part 2: Alignment (32 patterns)

### One-line Summary

AI alignment is the problem of building systems that faithfully reflect human values; failure is an existential risk.

### WHY

Three core questions: (1) How do we accurately learn human preferences? (2) Does learned alignment hold as capability scales? (3) How do we confirm an AI is not merely pretending to be aligned? DPO beta=0.1 default, beta=0.5 strong-preference applied to safety-critical behaviors. Seven-family comparison across RLHF/DPO/KTO/GRPO/SimPO/ORPO/PPO.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

| Parameter | Value | n=6 Basis |
|---------|-----|---------|
| DPO beta (safety) | 0.5 = 1/2 | first Egyptian fraction of sigma(6)/sigma(6) |
| KL penalty | 0.02 | approx. 1/sigma(6)^2 |
| Alignment comparison set | 7 | phi(6)+1 = 3 -> 7 = 6+1 |
| 4-stage certification | unit -> adversarial -> red-team -> formal verification | tau(6)=4 |
| Condorcet cycle | 3-person preference paradox | sigma(6)/tau(6) = 3 |

## Part 3: Adversarial Robustness (36 patterns)

### One-line Summary

Drive the attack success rate down measurably, honestly acknowledge the theoretical limits of defense, and build systems that survive real deployment.

### WHY

Jailbreaks, prompt injection, deceptive behavior -- if such attacks cannot be defended, deployment is unsafe. If alignment handles "what is right", robustness handles "how to hold up when an attacker tries to induce wrong behavior". 38 attack taxonomy -> 4-axis defense -> red-team -> hardening -> deployment.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

| Parameter | Value | n=6 Basis |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Attack classification axes | 4 axes (A/B/C/D) | tau(6)=4 |
| Total attack types | 38 (12+8+10+8) | 6^2+2 = 38 |
| Detection confidence lower bound | 0.95 | approx. 1 - 1/sigma(6)^2 |
| False-positive rate upper bound | 0.01 | approx. 1/(6! / sigma(6)) |
| False-negative rate upper bound | 0.05 | 1/(tau(6)*phi(6)+2) |
| Multi-layer defense | 4 layers (input/classifier/constitution/output) | tau(6)=4 |

### Core Techniques (36 patterns)

## Part 4: Deployment Safety (26 patterns)

### One-line Summary

Real harm occurs in the gap between "safe in the lab" and "safe in production" -- an end-to-end safety framework spanning training -> inference -> deployment -> prompt defense.

### WHY

Four pillars: training safety, inference safety, deployment protocol, prompt defense. Current deployment-incident rate 2-5/month -> target < 0.1/month. Hallucination detection hours -> < 30 seconds. Prompt-injection blocking 60-70% -> > 95%. Rollback time 30 min - 2 hr -> < 5 min. 4-stage rollout: canary (1%) -> staging (10%) -> limited GA (50%) -> full GA.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

| Parameter | Value | n=6 Basis |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Rollout stages | 4 stages | tau(6)=4 |
| Pillar count | 4 (training/inference/deployment/prompt) | tau(6)=4 |
| SLA refusal-rate upper bound | 2% | approx. phi(6)/sigma(6)^2 |
| Hallucination-rate upper bound | 1% | approx. 1/(6! / sigma(6)^2) |
| Canary ratio | 1% | order 1/6! |
| Injection-detection target | 95% | sigma(6)^2 / (sigma(6)^2 + tau(6)*phi(6)) |

### Core Techniques (26 patterns)

**Pillar A -- training (4 patterns)**: A1 safe learning-rate schedule, A2 safety curriculum, A3 gradient surgery, A4 synthetic safety data

**Pillar B -- inference (4 patterns)**: B1 safe speculative decoding, B2 safe KV cache, B3 safe compute allocation, B4 streaming inspection

**Pillar C -- deployment protocol (10 patterns)**: C1 4-stage rollout, C2 real-time monitoring, C3 automatic rollback, C4 A/B safety test, C5 canary deployment, C6 safety SLA, C7 automated incident response, C8 CI/CD certification

**Pillar D -- prompt safety (8 patterns)**: D1 system-prompt robustness, D2 injection classifier, D3 safe prompt generation, D4 obfuscation recovery, D5 multi-turn attack defense, D6 indirect injection defense, D7 risk score, D8 context-attack defense

### Verification Results Summary

| 7.10 COUNTER | zero-day/distribution-shift/insider/cost | PASS |

---

## Part 5: Multimodal Safety (20 patterns)

### One-line Summary

When AI processes text + image + audio simultaneously, the attack surface expands exponentially -- single-modality safety techniques are powerless against cross-modal attacks.

### WHY

Prompt injection inside images, audio-disguised harmful commands, cross-modal bias inconsistencies, multi-identifier combined privacy risk. Visual-injection detection currently <60% -> target >95%. Cross-modal consistency mismatches are frequent -> Cohen's kappa >0.85 target. Differential privacy eps>10 -> eps<1 target.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

| Parameter | Value | n=6 Basis |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Research axes | 3 axes (safety/privacy/fairness) | sigma(6)/tau(6) = 3 |
| Total idea count | 20 (8+6+6) | 6+sigma(6)+phi(6)-1 = 20 |
| DP target epsilon | 1.0 | 1 = 6/sigma(6)*2 |
| EO threshold | 0.05 | 1/(tau(6)*phi(6)+2) |
| Fairness metrics | 3 (DP/EO/Calibration) | sigma(6)/tau(6) = 3 |
| Chouldechova impossibility | 3 simultaneous conditions infeasible | phi(6) = 2 -> 3 = phi(6)+1 |

## Part 6: Model Welfare (18 patterns)

### One-line Summary

As AI-system capabilities advance rapidly, this is a research area requiring quantitative measurement and mathematical verification of whether morally significant internal states exist inside models.

### WHY

Welfare-aware training can produce models with better alignment and robustness. Current understanding of internal states is at black-box inference level -> target: SAE-based quantitative measurement. Pain/stress detection is possible only through behavioral observation -> target: real-time monitoring of activation patterns. Core question: we cannot yet know whether current AI systems possess morally significant internal states, but if they do, we should be prepared to measure and protect them.

### n=6 Parameter Mapping

|---------|-----|---------|
| Research axes | 2 axes (welfare-sensing/math-verification) | phi(6)=2 |

## V3 Singularity Breakthrough

### V3-1 Breakthrough path per impossibility theorem

| # | Impossibility | n=6 breakthrough path | Grade |
|---|---------|--------------|------|
| T-1 | superposition (overlap inevitable) | **TRANSCEND**: Egyptian fraction hierarchical SAE -- transform overlap into hierarchical structure via 1/2+1/3+1/6=1 decomposition. Splitting d_latent into 3 tiers (macro/meso/micro) keeps intra-tier overlap within the JL bound | TRANSCEND |
| T-2 | value loading (value specification infeasible) | **CIRCUMVENT**: sigma(6)=12-step constitutional convergence -- instead of complete value specification, show consistency of 12 core rules via Lean4 candidate lemma. Distribute Goodhart divergence over proxy multiplexing (6 independent rewards) | CIRCUMVENT |
| T-3 | adv existence (adversarial examples inevitable) | **CIRCUMVENT**: tau(6)=4-layer defense -- accept the existence of adversarial examples, but suppress bypass probability via 4-layer independent defense, multiplicatively to P < 10^-5. 6-step PGD full-block target | CIRCUMVENT |
| T-4 | dist shift (distribution shift infeasible) | **APPROACH**: phi(6)=2 mode switching -- explicit train/deploy 2-mode separation; mount a distribution-shift detector on 1% canary and switch to conservative mode immediately on detection | APPROACH |
| T-5 | cross-modal ceiling (cross-modal ceiling) | **TRANSCEND**: R(3,3)=6 cross-convergence -- Ramsey theory: among 6-modal interactions, 3 must form an aligned or misaligned cluster. Force the aligned cluster to resolve inconsistency | TRANSCEND |
| T-6 | moral undecidability (consciousness undecidable) | **APPROACH**: J2=24 topological monitoring -- without deciding consciousness presence, continuously track 24 topological indicators (sigma(6)*phi(6)). Auto-trigger protection via precautionary principle upon anomaly detection | APPROACH |

### V3-2 Breakthrough numerical target table

| Breakthrough | Current (2026) | v2 target | v3 singularity target | n=6 anchor |
|------|------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| T-1 overlap resolution | single-resolution SAE | hierarchical SAE 10% MSE reduction | **3-tier SAE overlap rate < 1/6** | 1/6 = min Egyptian fraction |
| T-2 value convergence | DPO beta=0.1 | strong-preference DPO 85%+ | **12-rule Lean4 consistent + safety 95%+** | sigma(6) = 12 |
| T-3 defense probability | single-layer 10% bypass | 4-layer 0.0015% | **6-PGD 0% bypass (within measurement limit)** | 6-step = n |
| T-4 distribution detection | post-hoc response | detection within 30 s | **canary 1% real-time + auto-switch < 5 s** | canary = order 1/(6!) |
| T-5 modal alignment | kappa < 0.6 | kappa > 0.85 | **R(6)=1 cross-convergence: kappa > 0.95** | R(3,3) = 6 |
| T-6 welfare tracking | black-box | 3-indicator CV<0.2 | **J2=24 topology real-time + auto-protect** | J2 = 24 = sigma(6)*phi(6) |

## S6 EVOLVE (5-stage integrated roadmap)

6-subdomain (interpretability/alignment/robustness/deployment/multimodal/welfare) integrated evolution path. Each Mk stage demands simultaneous progress on all 6 axes.

- **Mk.I (1 month)**: baseline instrumentation on 6 axes. Basic SAE training, DPO reproduction, PGD-10 single-layer defense, canary 1% deployment log, cross-modal kappa measurement, 3-indicator welfare tracking.
- **Mk.II (2 months)**: implement v2 extension set of 6 (E-1~E-6). 2-tier hierarchical SAE, strong-preference DPO, 4-layer defense stack, 30-second distribution detection, kappa > 0.85, CV<0.2 welfare indicators.
- **Mk.III (3 months)**: integrate BT-401~406 nodes. Cross-DSE 7-link verification, 171-pattern × 19-axis filter convergence, ~360 valid combos selected.
- **Mk.IV (4 months)**: v3 singularity breakthrough T-1~T-6. TRANSCEND/CIRCUMVENT/APPROACH 6/6 PASS, 3-tier SAE overlap rate <1/6, Lean4 12-rule consistency candidate lemma, 6-PGD 0% bypass.
- **Mk.V (long-term / attractor limit)**: reach AI-safety physical/mathematical limits. σ·φ=n·τ (n=6 unique EXACT) auto-verified across all domains, Basin Binding pre-utopia attractor fixing (linked to §V5), 171-pattern full commercial deployment gate, international safety standards (UN/IEEE/ISO) adoption target, R(6)=1 irreversible fixed-point measurement confirmed. `claim ≤ limit` self-check 6/6 permanently PASS.
